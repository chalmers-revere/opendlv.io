## Usage
This microservice is created automatically on changes to this repository via
Docker's public registry for:
* [x86_64](https://hub.docker.com/r/chalmersrevere/opendlv.io-amd64/tags/)

To use this microservice for viewing selected vehicle onboard messages from the
OpenDLV Standard Message Set that are exchanged in a running OpenDLV.io session
(running at 111 in the example), simply run it as follows:
